          <h1>About Me!</h1>
          <p id="intro">Can you believe that I am coding right now. This stuff is extremely hard for a kid out of Long Beach. 
            Not to mention being incarcerated for 20 years. Being free, I couldn't dream this at one point. I am 40 years old.
            I enjoy almost any sport. I love to learn. This coding stuff is so fast. I'll probably be repeating this 
            class if Maria and Jason allow. I am married to my wife Ashley and we have four kids. 
            The picture of me on a plane is when I got the opportunity to go to Washington D.C. for a teachers conference. I never flew in my life before I was incarcerated. 
            I have flown three different times in the last six months. Crazy right!? The video is of my nephew Eric and my grand-niece Avianna.
            Here are some things about me:</p>
